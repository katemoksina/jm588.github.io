	Christmas used to be a time for giving, a time for joy and a time to celebrate the birth of our lord, Jesus Christ. But mankind has become lost in their greed and self-indulgence. They need to find Jesus. <p>
Which is why we created the Jesus Finder app. Now you can find where Jesus is anywhere in the world. Choose from different Jesus's and be shown where they are. Once you found Jesus, you will get an inspirational quote from him, then you can share where you found him on Facebook or Twitter. Seek, and you will find.<p>
